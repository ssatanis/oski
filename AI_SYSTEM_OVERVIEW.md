- Chief complaint documentation
- History of present illness
- Past medical/surgical history
- Medications and allergies
- Family and social history

### Physical Examination (8-25 points)
- Systematic examination techniques
- Vital signs assessment
- Body system examinations
- Professional technique demonstration

### Diagnostic Reasoning (6-18 points)
- Clinical reasoning process
- Differential diagnosis formation
- Evidence integration
- Sound clinical judgment

### Management (3-11 points)
- Treatment planning
- Patient education
- Follow-up recommendations
- Referral decisions

### Specialized Examinations
- **Dermatological**: Skin inspection, lesion assessment
- **Cardiovascular**: Heart auscultation, pulse examination
- **Respiratory**: Lung auscultation, breathing assessment
- **Neurological**: Reflex testing, mental status
- **Musculoskeletal**: Range of motion, spine examination
- **Abdominal**: Palpation, percussion, auscultation

## API Endpoints

### `/api/ai-rubric-analyzer`

- **Input**: `extracted_text`, `filename`
- **Output**: Structured criteria with examples and points
- **Features**: Training data integration, pattern matching, intelligent defaults

### `/api/generate-prompt` 
- **Purpose**: YAML generation from criteria
- **Input**: `extracted_text`, `filename`, OR `dashboard_criteria`

## Training Data Integration

The AI system automatically loads and processes:
- 24 YAML prompt files from your existing collection
- Medical examination patterns and examples
- Scoring schemas and time formats
- Professional verbalization examples

### Training Examples Include:
- `1A.yaml`: Skin inspection and gown adjustment
- `2A.yaml`: Abdominal palpation and kidney percussion
- `abdominal_pain.yaml`: Comprehensive abdominal assessment
- `back_pain.yaml`: Musculoskeletal examination
- `chest_pain.yaml`: Cardiovascular assessment
- Plus 19 additional specialized assessment files

## Unique Content Generation

Each document upload generates unique content through:

### Content Hashing
- Creates unique fingerprint for each file
- Generates 5 different variations (0-4)
- Ensures no two files produce identical output

### Filename Intelligence
- Recognizes medical conditions (psoriasis, back pain, kidney stone)
- Adapts examination types accordingly
- Includes condition-specific assessments

### Variation System
- **Variation 0**: Basic level assessments
- **Variation 1**: Intermediate complexity
- **Variation 2**: Standard medical protocols
- **Variation 3**: Advanced assessments
- **Variation 4**: Comprehensive evaluations

## YAML Output Format

Generated YAML files match your exact training format:

```yaml
system_message: |
   You are a helpful assistant tasked with analyzing and scoring a recorded medical examination between a medical student and a patient. Provide your response in JSON format.
   
user_message: |
   Your task is to identify the start and end times of specific medical assessments...
   
   You need to identify the following medical assessments from this transcript:
   1. History_Taking: Did the doctor perform history taking?
      - Verbalization examples: Can you tell me about your symptoms?, When did this start?
   
   2. Physical_Examination: Did the doctor perform physical examination?
      - Verbalization examples: I'm going to examine you now, I'm going to listen to your heart
   
response_config:
  structured_output: True
```
