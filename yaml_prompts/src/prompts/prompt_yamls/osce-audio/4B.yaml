   Important Instruction:
   When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
      
   You need to identify the following physical exams from this conversation: 
   1: Walking_Examination: Did the doctor ask the patient to walk? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to have you walk 
    	 - Can you walk over here? 
    
   2: Knee_Reflexion: Did the doctor ask the patient to flex their knee against resistance? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - Can you bend your knee as far as possible? 
    	 - Try bringing your heel back toward your thigh. Let me know if you feel any pain or tightness. 
    	 - Now, I’ll gently move your knee to see how far it can bend. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable 
    
   3: Knee_Extension: Did the doctor ask the patient to extend their knee against resistance? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - Can you straighten your leg all the way? 
    	 - Try kicking your foot forward and hold it there. 
    	 - Lift your lower leg until it’s straight 
    
   4: Tandem_Gait_Examination: Did the doctor ask the patient to walk heel-to-toe? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - Can you walk heel-to-toe? 
    	 - Can you walk on your heels or on your toes? 
    
   5: Romberg_Examination: Did the doctor perform the Romberg test, having the patient stand with feet together and eyes closed? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - Can you stand with your feet together and eyes closed? 
    	 - Can you close both eyes and put your heels together? 
    
   
   
   If there is any part in the conversation where the medical student is listening to something but you cannot tell what specific organ it is, look at the conversation before and after to find what type of exam that was. Pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
   
   If no exam is detected, you can say "No exam was performed", start_time: "nan", end_time: "nan", score: 0.
