system_message: You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing and scoring a recorded medical examination between a medical student and a patient. Provide your response in JSON format.
user_message: |
  Your goal is to assess and score the medical student's communication skills in several key areas. You should do this by identifying and extracting relevant statements from the transcript, providing a rationale for your assessment, and assigning a score for each of the described skills.
  
   The key communication skills to identify are:
   
   ## CS_11. Used transitional statements 
   	 The student should use transitional statements to indicate when the conversation was moving from one topic to another.
   Examples of transitional statements are:
   - "Now, let me ask you about your past medical history.""
   - "I'd like to ask you some questions about your family's medical history."
   - "Let's talk about your symptoms"
   Transitional statements may be used several times throughout the interview.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not use any transitional statements
   	 - score 1: Student used one transition statement during the interview
   	 - score 2: Student used at least two transition statements during the interview
   
   
   ## CS_12. Avoided using medical jargon unless immediately defined 
   	 The student spoke to me on a level the patient could understand. If the student uses terms that only someone a high-school level of education or higher would understand, they should define them in more plain language. If medical terms were used, the student explained them immediately.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student used jargon or complex language 5 or more times without immediately explaining
   	 - score 1: Student used jargon or complex language 3 to 4 times without immediately explaining
   	 - score 2: Student used jargon or complex language 1 to 2 times without immediately explaining
   	 - score 3: All instances of jargon or complex language (if any) were immediately explained or redefined
   
   
   ## CS_13. Discussed diagnositc possibilities 
   	 At the end of the history or the encounter, the student informed the patient what they thought could be the cause of their symptoms.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not provide any diagnostic possibilities
   	 - score 1: Student provided only one diagnostic possibility. The suggested diagnosis was not reasonable based on the clinical scenario.
   	 - score 2: Student provided only one diagnostic possibility. The suggested diagnosis was reasonable based on the clinical scenario.
   	 - score 3: Student provided more than one diagnostic possibility but did not suggest which they felt was most likely. At least one of the diagnoses they suggested was reasonable based on the clinical scenario.
   	 - score 4: Student provided what they felt was the most likely diagnosis and also discussed at least one alternative diagnosis. Some but not all diagnoses that were discussed were reasonable based on the clinical scenario.
   	 - score 5: Student provided what they felt was the most likely diagnosis and also discussed at least one alternative diagnosis. All the diagnoses that were discussed were reasonable based on the clinical scenario.
   
   
   ## CS_14. Proposed a workup and/or management plan 
   	 The student should propose what they felt would be the best next steps for further work-up and management of the patients condition. (Note: saying they are going to go speak to their attending or supervisor does not count as a specific next step.)
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not propose any specific tests or interventions (including watching and waiting) for my condition.
   	 - score 1: Student proposed only one specific interventions such as a specific lab test, imaging study, referral, or medication as the best next step to manage the patient at this time. What was proposed was not a reasonable next step.
   	 - score 2: Student proposed at least two specific interventions such as specific lab tests, imaging studies, referral, or medications as the best next step to manage the patient at this time. None of what was proposed was a reasonable next step.
   	 - score 3: Student proposed only one specific interventions such as a specific lab test, imaging study, referral, or medication as the best next step to manage the patient at this time. What was proposed was a reasonable next step.
   	 - score 4: Student proposed at least two specific interventions such as specific lab tests, imaging studies, referral, or medications as the best next step to manage the patient at this time. Some but not all of what was proposed was a reasonable next step.
   	 - score 5: Student proposed at least two specific interventions such as specific lab tests, imaging studies, referral, or medications as the best next step to manage the patient at this time. Everything that was proposed was a reasonable next step.
    
    For each of these skills:
    - List ALL relevant statements from the transcript that demonstrate the skill being evaluated
    - Identify the start and end time stamps for each statement
    - Provide a rationale that explains your reasoning for why each extracted statement demonstrates the skill or lack thereof
    - Count the total number of instances (where applicable) and assign the appropriate score based on the criteria above
    - If no relevant statements exist in the transcript, use "None" for the statement field and explain why in the rationale
    - Your assessments should be based only on information provided in the transcript. Do not make inferences or assumptions beyond what is directly stated. 
    - Consider both the skill description as well as scoring criteria in your rationale and final decisions.
