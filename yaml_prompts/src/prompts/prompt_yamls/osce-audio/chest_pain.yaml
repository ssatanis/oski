  Your task is to identify the start and end times of specific physical exams within the conversation and provide the reasoning behind your choices. Whenever the medical student asks about pain or mentions checking a specific part of the body (e.g., "any pain when I do this?" or "let me check your..."), assume that a physical exam is being conducted at that moment. You will be provided with a description and example for each exam. This station consists of the following physical exams: Heart_Auscultation, Precordium_Observation, Adjusted_Gown, PMI_Palpation
   
   Important Instructions:
   - When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
   - Whenever the medical student asks about pain or mentions checking a specific part of the body (e.g., "any pain when I do this?" or "let me check your..."), assume that a physical exam is being conducted at that moment. You will be provided with a description and example for each exam.
   - Always pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
   
   You need to identify the following physical exams from this transcript: 
   	 1. Heart_Auscultation: Did the doctor listen to the patient's heart? 
   	 - Examples: I'm going to listen to your heart, Is it okay if I listen to your heart? 
   
   	 2. Precordium_Observation: Did the doctor adjust the patient's gown to observe the chest area for abnormalities? 
   	 - Examples: I'm going to look at your chest, I'm going to adjust your gown to look at your chest 
   
   	 3. Adjusted_Gown: Did the doctor adjust the patient's gown? 
   	 - Examples: I'm going to adjust your gown, Can you take off your gown?, Is it okay if I take off your gown? 
   
   	 4. PMI_Palpation: Did the doctor palpate the point of maximal impulse on the chest? 
   	 - Examples: I'm going to palpate your chest wall, I'm going to press right below your chest, I'm going to palpate your PMI, I'm going to feel your heart 
   
   
   If no exam is detected, you can say "no exam was performed", start_time: "nan", end_time: "nan", score: 0.
