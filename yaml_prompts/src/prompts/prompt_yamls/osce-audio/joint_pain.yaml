   Your task is to identify the start and end times of specific physical exams within the conversation and provide the reasoning behind your choices. Whenever the medical student asks about pain or mentions checking a specific part of the body (e.g., "any pain when I do this?" or "let me check your..."), assume that a physical exam is being conducted at that moment. You will be provided with a description and example for each exam. This station consists of the following physical exams: Finger_Abduction, Finger_Adduction, Finger_Extension, Finger_Flexion, Finger_Extension, Finger_Abduction, Hand_Grip_Evaluation, Joint_Palpation
   
   Important Instructions:  
   - When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
   - Whenever the medical student asks about pain or mentions checking a specific part of the body (e.g., "any pain when I do this?" or "let me check your..."), assume that a physical exam is being conducted at that moment. You will be provided with a description and example for each exam.
   - Always pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
