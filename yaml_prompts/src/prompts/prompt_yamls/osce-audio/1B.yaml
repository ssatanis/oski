   Important Instruction:
   When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
      
   You need to identify the following physical exams from this conversation: 
   1: Adjusted_Gown: Did the doctor adjust the patient's gown? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to adjust your gown 
    	 - Can you take off your gown? 
    	 - Is it okay if I take off your gown? 
    
   2: Skin_Inspection: Did the doctor inspect the patient's skin by looking closely at their entire body, including lowering the gown and examining their chest and back? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’m going to inspect your skin closely to check for any rashes, discoloration, or other changes 
    	 - I’m looking for any redness, swelling, lesions, or other abnormalities on your skin 
    	 - I’m lowering your gown slightly to examine your chest and back 
    
   
   
   If there is any part in the conversation where the medical student is listening to something but you cannot tell what specific organ it is, look at the conversation before and after to find what type of exam that was. Pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
   
   If no exam is detected, you can say "No exam was performed", start_time: "nan", end_time: "nan", score: 0.
