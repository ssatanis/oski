   Important Instruction:
   When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
      
   You need to identify the following physical exams from this conversation: 
   1: Spinal_Palpation: Did the doctor palpate down the mid lower back assessing the patient's spine and paraspinal regions for tenderness? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’m going to start at the top of your back and work my way down. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness as I press 
    	 - I’m going to press along your spine and the muscles on either side to check for any tenderness or discomfort. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable 
    
   2: Cotton_Swab_Usage: Did the doctor use a cotton swab to lightly touch the patient's legs to assess sensation? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your legs with this cotton swab. Please let me know if you can feel it. 
    	 - I’ll be using a soft object to see how well you can feel touch on your legs. 
    
   3: Verbalize_Same_Both_Side: Did the doctor ask if it feels the same on both sides? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - Can you feel this? Does it feel the same on this side as it does on the other side 
    
   4: Light_Touch_Thigh_Upper_Leg: Did the doctor use a cotton swab to lightly touch the patient's thighs or upper legs to assess sensation? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’m going to check how well you can feel a light touch on your upper leg. I’ll use this soft cotton swab. Please let me know if you can feel it. 
    	 - I’ll touch a few different spots on your thigh. Tell me if it feels the same on both sides. 
    	 - I’m going to check the sensation on your upper leg 
    
   5: Knee_Reflex_Examination: Did the doctor assess the patient's knee reflexes? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to tap on your knees 
    	 - I'm going to tap on your kneecap with a hammer 
    
   6: Light_Touch_Below_Ankle: Did the doctor use a cotton swab to lightly touch the patient's leg below the ankle to assess sensation? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’ll touch a few areas just below your ankle. Please tell me if the sensation is different or if you don’t feel it at all 
    	 - To make the test more accurate, I’ll ask you to close your eyes while I touch the area below your ankle. Just say 'yes' when you feel it. 
    
   7: Light_Touch_Shin_Knee: Did the doctor use a cotton swab to lightly touch the patient's shin or knee to assess sensation? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’m going to use this cotton swab to check how well you can feel light touch on your shin and knee 
    	 - Can you feel this? Does it feel the same on this side as it does on the other side 
    
   
   
   If there is any part in the conversation where the medical student is listening to something but you cannot tell what specific organ it is, look at the conversation before and after to find what type of exam that was. Pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
   
   If no exam is detected, you can say "No exam was performed", start_time: "nan", end_time: "nan", score: 0.
