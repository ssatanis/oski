   Important Instruction:
   When determining the start and end times of each examination, focus on the moments where the doctor instructs the patient to perform an action (e.g., "look up at the ceiling", "look straight ahead"). Give these phrases priority for setting the `start_time` and `end_time` over phrases where the doctor states their own actions (e.g., "I'm going to look at your nose and eyes").
      
   You need to identify the following physical exams from this conversation: 
   1: Heart_Auscultation: Did the doctor listen to the patient's heart? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to listen to your heart 
    	 - Is it okay if I listen to your heart? 
    	 - Breathe normally 
    - Wrong Examples: (these are NOT examples of the correct physical exam) 
    	 - Pressing on the heart 
    	 - Breathe in deeply 
    
   2: Radial_Pulse_Palpation: Did the doctor palpate the patient's radial pulse? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I’d like to check the pulse at your wrist 
    	 - I’m going to feel your pulse 
    
   3: PMI_Palpation: Did the doctor palpate the point of maximal impulse on the chest? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to palpate your chest wall 
    	 - I'm going to press right below your chest 
    	 - I'm going to palpate your PMI 
    	 - I'm going to feel your heart 
    
   4: Lung_Auscultation: Did the doctor listen to the patient's lungs? 
    - Examples: 
    	 - I'm going to listen to your lungs 
    	 - Breathe in deeply 
    	 - Is it okay if I listen to your lungs? 
    - Wrong Examples: (these are NOT examples of the correct physical exam) 
    	 - Breathe in normally 
    	 - I'm going to listen to your heart 
    
   
   
   If there is any part in the conversation where the medical student is listening to something but you cannot tell what specific organ it is, look at the conversation before and after to find what type of exam that was. Pay close attention to surrounding context and related physical examinations mentioned.
   
   If no exam is detected, you can say "No exam was performed", start_time: "nan", end_time: "nan", score: 0.
