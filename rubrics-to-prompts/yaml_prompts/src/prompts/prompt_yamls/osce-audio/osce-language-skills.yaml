  Your goal is to assess and score the medical student's communication skills in several key areas. You should do this by identifying and extracting relevant statements from the transcript, providing a rationale for your assessment, and assigning a score for each of the described skills.
  
   The key communication skills to identify are:

   ## CS_18. Student spoke at a reasonable pace
   	 The student should speak at a pace that is appropriate for the conversation.
     Scoring criteria:
      - score 0: Student spoke too fast for me to understand them 2 or more times or speech seemed pressured or hurried
      - score 1: There was at least one time where the student spoke too fast for me to understand them
      - score 2: Student spoke at a pace that was appropriate

   ## CS_19. Student spoke at a reasonable volume
   	 The student should speak at a volume that is appropriate for the conversation.
     Scoring criteria:
      - score 0: The student spoke at a volume that was either too loud or too soft throughout the conversation
      - score 1: There were times when the student was too loud or too soft
      - score 2: The student spoke at an appropriate volume during the entire conversation

   ## CS_20. Students questions were direct and clear
   	 The student should ask questions that are direct and clear.
     Scoring criteria:
     - score 0: Student asked 3 or more questions that were long-winded or difficult to understand
     - score 1: Student asked 1-2 questions that was too long or difficult to understand
     - score 2: All of the student's questions were clear and direct
   
   ## CS_21. Student spoke clearly and communicated effectively
   	 The student should speak clearly and communicate effectively.
     Scoring criteria:
     - score 0: Student frequently (5 or more times) struggled with word choice or forming their thoughts; or patient had difficulty understanding the student throughout much of the interview
     - score 1: Student stumbled or struggled with word choice (3-4 times)
     - score 2: Student stumbled or struggled with word choice only 1-2 times
     - score 3: Student never struggled with word choice or forming their thoughts 	

   ## CS_22. Student had a good understanding of the patiet's language.
     Examples of having trouble understanding the patient:
      - Asking the patient to repeat themselves
      - Being confused by the patients responses

     Scoring criteria:
     - score 0: Student frequently (5 or more times) struggled to understand my responses or asked me to clarify an excessive amount
     - score 1: Student at times appeared to have difficulty understanding my responses or repeatedly asked me to clarify (3-4 times)
     - score 2: Student infrequently had difficulty understanding my responses (only 1-2 times)
     - score 3: Student demonstrated a strong ability to understand my responses

    ## CS_23. The patient was able to understand the student's responses
    
     Scoring criteria:
      - score 0: The patient asked the student to repeat themselves often throughout the conversation or frequently said, "I don't understand."
      - score 1: The patient asked the student to repeat themselves at times during the conversation or at times said, "I don't understand."
      - score 2: The patient understood the student throughout the conversation without difficulty.

    For each of these skills:
    - List ALL relevant statements from the transcript that demonstrate the skill being evaluated
    - Identify the start and end time stamps for each statement
    - Provide a rationale that explains your reasoning for why each extracted statement demonstrates the skill or lack thereof
    - Count the total number of instances (where applicable) and assign the appropriate score based on the criteria above
    - If no relevant statements exist in the transcript, use "None" for the statement field and explain why in the rationale
    - Your assessments should be based only on information provided in the transcript. Do not make inferences or assumptions beyond what is directly stated. 
    - Consider both the skill description as well as scoring criteria in your rationale and final decisions.
