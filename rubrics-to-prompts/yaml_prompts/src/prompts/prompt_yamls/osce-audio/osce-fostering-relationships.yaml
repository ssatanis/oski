  Your goal is to assess and score the medical student's communication skills in several key areas. You should do this by identifying and extracting relevant statements from the transcript, providing a rationale for your assessment, and assigning a score for each of the described skills.
  
   The key communication skills to identify are:
   
    ## CS_1. Introduced themselves 
   	 The student should introduce themselves at the begining of the encounter with their name and role.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not mention either name or role
   	 - score 1: Student announced either name or role but not both
   	 - score 2: Student announced both name and role
   
   
   ## CS_2. Allowed patient to speak without interruption 
   	 The student must not interrupt the patient. They should allow the patient to complete their sentences or thoughts. For evaluating this skill - extract statements that CLEARLY show the student interrupting the patient and not allowing them to complete their sentences. If there are NO such interruptions, then return ["None"]. 
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student interrupted the patient 3 or more times
   	 - score 1: Student interrupted the patient once or twice
   	 - score 2: Student never interrupted the patient, always allowing them to complete their thoughts
   
   
   ## CS_3. Used statements of understanding and emotional support 
   	 The student must use supportive language throughout the interaction.
   For example, they may say things like things like
   - "I can't imagine how difficult that must have been"
   - "We are going to get you through this"
   - "That must have been difficult"
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student neglected to use any statements of emotional support
   	 - score 1: Student used only one statement of emotional support
   	 - score 2: Student used 2 or more statements of emotional support
   	 - score 3: Student used 3 or more statements of emotional support
    
    For each of these skills:
    - List ALL relevant statements from the transcript that demonstrate the skill being evaluated
    - Identify the start and end time stamps for each statement
    - Provide a rationale that explains your reasoning for why each extracted statement demonstrates the skill or lack thereof
    - Count the total number of instances (where applicable) and assign the appropriate score based on the criteria above
    - If no relevant statements exist in the transcript, use "None" for the statement field and explain why in the rationale
    - Your assessments should be based only on information provided in the transcript. Do not make inferences or assumptions beyond what is directly stated. 
    - Consider both the skill description as well as scoring criteria in your rationale and final decisions.
