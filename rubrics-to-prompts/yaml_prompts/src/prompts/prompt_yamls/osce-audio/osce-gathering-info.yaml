  Your goal is to assess and score the medical student's communication skills in several key areas. You should do this by identifying and extracting relevant statements from the transcript, providing a rationale for your assessment, and assigning a score for each of the described skills.
  
   The key communication skills to identify are:
      
   ## CS_4. Used open ended questions at the beggining 
   	 At the beginning of the interview, the student asked questions that allowed the patient to reply in a few sentences, telling their own story. The student should attempt to keep the interview open-ended to solicit most of the elements of the history of patient illness. They may need to move to more closed-ended questions to gather specific information about the history or to clarify details of the patient's history as the interview progresses. 
   
    In general, open-ended questions are not able to be answered with a "yes" or "no". Examples of open-ended questions that do not control the direction of the interview:
     - What brings you in today?
     - How have you been feeling?
     - Tell me more about that.
     - What concerns you about that?
     - Do you have any thoughts about what might be causing that?
     - When did you first observe that?
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student neglected to use any open ended questions or only used a single open-ended question to begin the interview.
   	 - score 1: Student used only one open-ended question after the initial question.
   	 - score 2: Student used 2-3 open ended questions during the interview after the initial question.
   	 - score 3: Student appropriately used at least 4 open-ended questions during the interview after the initial question.
   
   
   ## CS_5. Used strategic silence 
   	 Student used silence and remained attentive during silence as a means to encourage patient to keep talking. Note: awkward silence or searching for words does not count as strategic silence
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not use any strategic silence during the interview
   	 - score 1: Student used strategic silence at least once at the beginning of the interview
   
   
   ## CS_6. Used neutral utterances 
   	 The student should use neutral utterances to encourage the patient to keep talking during their interaction.
   Expressions like "uh-huh," "yes," or "hmm" are examples of neutral utterances that the student can use to encourage the patient to keep talking.
   You do not need to extract all instances of neutral utterances, just one or two is enough.
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not use any neutral utterances
   	 - score 1: Student used at least one neutral utterance
   
   
   ## CS_7. Used echoing 
   	 The student must demonstrate 'echoing' during their interaction. Echoing is the practice of repeating a word or phrase immediately after spoken by the patient to encouraging the patient to elaborate further.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not exhibit any echoing during the interview
   	 - score 1: Student used echoing at least once during the interview
   
   
   ## CS_8. Avoided using leading questions 
   	 The student must not use leading questions that bias the patient towards a certain answer. For example, "You don't have any pain, do you?" is a leading question. 
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student used 4 or more leading questions during the interview
   	 - score 1: Student used 2-3 leading questions during the interview
   	 - score 2: Student used only 1 leading question during the interview
   	 - score 3: Student used no leading question during the interview
   
   
   ## CS_9. Avoided using multiple or compound questions 
   	 The student should not ask compound questions or multiple questions at the same time. For example: "Have you had fever, headache, or pain?", or, "When did it start and how bad would you rate it?" are examples of compound questions that ask several things in one go. 
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student used 3 or more compound questions during interview
   	 - score 1: Student 2 compound questions during interview
   	 - score 2: Student used 1 compund question during interview
   	 - score 3: Student used no compound questions during interview
   
   
   ## CS_10. Summarized the history 
   	 Near the end of the discussion, the student should repeat or rephrase key information that the patient provided during the encounter to show they were listening and understand the patient's history. The aim of providing such a summary is to ensure that they understand the patient's symptoms accurately and give them a chance to verify this information.
    
   	 Scoring criteria:
   	 - score 0: Student did not attempt to summarize the history of the present illness (HPI)
   	 - score 1: Student gave an incomplete attempt at summarizing the HPI, mentioned four or fewer elements in their summary
   	 - score 2: Student performed an adequate summary of the HPI noting five or more elements of the history in their summary
    
    For each of these skills:
    - List ALL relevant statements from the transcript that demonstrate the skill being evaluated
    - Identify the start and end time stamps for each statement
    - Provide a rationale that explains your reasoning for why each extracted statement demonstrates the skill or lack thereof
    - Count the total number of instances (where applicable) and assign the appropriate score based on the criteria above
    - If no relevant statements exist in the transcript, use "None" for the statement field and explain why in the rationale
    - Your assessments should be based only on information provided in the transcript. Do not make inferences or assumptions beyond what is directly stated. 
    - Consider both the skill description as well as scoring criteria in your rationale and final decisions.
